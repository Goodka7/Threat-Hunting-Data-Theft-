# Threat Hunt Report: Data Theft
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/Goodka7/Threat-Hunting-Malicious-Execution-/blob/main/resources/Threat-Hunt-Event(Data%20Theft).md)
- 
## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Bash

## Scenario

Management has raised concerns about a potential data exfiltration attempt by an employee on the verge of being fired. The employee is suspected of copying sensitive company information—such as fake credit card information and fake user account details—into a folder and encrypting it to prepare for extraction. This data could potentially be moved off the system for malicious purposes. Security teams have detected unusual file activities on the machine, such as file copying, encryption, and file movement, suggesting that the employee may be attempting to hide or secure the data before leaving the organization.

## High-Level IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for file manipulation associated with sensitive company information.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched for processes running on the system, specifically looking for signs of suspicious file movement and encryption activities. Initial investigations led to the discovery of potentially suspicious processes on the device **"thlinux"** run by the user **"baddog"**.

At Feb 6, 2025 9:48:01 AM, the user "baddog" executed the following command on the device "thlinux":

`
mv /usr/bin/mv
`

This command is a system operation for moving files. The mv command typically indicates the movement of files, and this event could point to suspicious file handling activities. However, further investigation is required to identify the specific files being moved.

At Feb 6, 2025 9:24:31 AM, the user "baddog" executed the following command on the device "thlinux":

`
openssl
`

This command is associated with the execution of the openssl encryption tool. The frequent execution of openssl could indicate that the user was involved in encrypting files, which may be part of an attempt to obscure or protect sensitive data.

These findings suggest that "baddog" was involved in file manipulation, including movement and potential encryption of sensitive data on the device "thlinux". Further investigation is required to determine the exact files involved in these actions.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == 'thlinux'
| order by Timestamp desc

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == 'thlinux'
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "mv" or ProcessCommandLine contains "openssl"
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## **Chronological Event Timeline**

### 1. Process Execution - Encrypting Data (Command: `openssl`)

- **Time:** `Feb 6, 2025 9:24:31 AM`
- **Event:** The employee **"baddog"** executed the **`openssl`** command to encrypt data on the system.
- **Action:** Process execution detected.
- **Command:** `openssl`
- **File Path:** `/usr/bin/openssl`

### 2. Process Execution - File Movement (Command: `mv`)

- **Time:** `Feb 6, 2025 9:24:37 AM`
- **Event:** The employee **"baddog"** executed the **`mv`** command to move files on the system.
- **Action:** Process execution detected.
- **Command:** `mv /home/baddog/extracted_data/fake_cards.enc /home/baddog/extracted_data/`
- **File Path:** `/usr/bin/mv`

### 3. Process Execution - Encrypting Data (Command: `openssl`)

- **Time:** `Feb 6, 2025 9:47:42 AM`
- **Event:** The employee **"baddog"** executed the **`openssl`** command again to encrypt data on the system.
- **Action:** Process execution detected.
- **Command:** `openssl`
- **File Path:** `/usr/bin/openssl`

### 4. Process Execution - File Movement (Command: `mv`)

- **Time:** `Feb 6, 2025 9:48:01 AM`
- **Event:** The employee **"baddog"** executed the **`mv`** command again, likely for moving files to a new location after encryption.
- **Action:** Process execution detected.
- **Command:** `mv /home/baddog/extracted_data/fake_user.enc /home/baddog/extracted_data/`
- **File Path:** `/usr/bin/mv`

---

### **Summary**

The user "baddog" on the device "thlinux" executed several actions that resulted in the movement and encryption of sensitive files, likely to obscure or secure them before potential exfiltration. The employee executed commands to move files and encrypt them using **`mv`** and **`openssl`** commands. The following files were involved:

- **Encrypted Files**: `fake_cards.enc`, `fake_user.enc`
- **Original Files**: `fake_cards.txt`, `fake_user.txt`

These actions indicate that **"baddog"** was involved in file manipulation, including movement and potential encryption of sensitive data on the device **"thlinux"**. Immediate action is required to assess the integrity of the files and investigate whether any unauthorized data movement or exfiltration occurred.

---

## Response Taken

The suspicious file manipulation and encryption activities performed by the employee "baddog" on the device "thlinux" were confirmed. The device was immediately isolated to prevent any further risks.

I suggest the encrypted files (`fake_cards.enc`, `fake_user.enc`) be reviewed to ensure no sensitive data was exfiltrated. The employee's direct manager was notified, and a recommendation was made to educate the employee on the risks of file manipulation and unauthorized encryption usage.

Further monitoring is being conducted to ensure no unauthorized access or data exfiltration occurred during the period of exposure.
