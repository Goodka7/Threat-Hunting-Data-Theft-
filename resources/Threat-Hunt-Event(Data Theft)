# Threat Event (Data Theft)

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took to Create Logs and IoCs:

1. Create a folder and a few files housing "sensetive corparate" information.
2. Create a folder for the bad actor to transfer the files to.
3. Move the files into the bad actors folder.
4. Encrypt the files using OpenSSL.
5. Make another folder that mimics an External Drive.
6. Move the files to said folder.
